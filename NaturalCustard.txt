Natural - not using custard packets which are either expensive or cheap and not too good.
Some store packets are missing eggs, using only cornstarch, preservatives etc.

Custard ingredients:

1/2 cup sugar.
2 1/2 tbsp corn starch 
1 tbsp flour (all purpose)
1 tsp vanilla
2 egg yolks
1 whole egg

2 cups milk.
----------------------

Mix cornstarch, flour, sugar. Add 1/4 cup milk.
Add egg yolks, add 1 full egg, vanilla. Mix well.

Boil the remaining 1 3/4 cups milk. Once it starts boiling.
Add the mixture and stir till it becomes custard.

Can use this as filling for pies, cakes, eclairs or just mix with fruit and serve etc
Can even mix with whipped cream and call it custard cream..
